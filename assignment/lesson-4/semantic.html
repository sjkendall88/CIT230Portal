        <header><h1>This page is to help remeber the Semantic HTML5 tags!</h1></header>
        <p>I have struggled to reconsiile the an internal conflict of the main tag and body tag.
        Through the Mozilla developer documents returned from a google search. The "main" tag is for
        the main part of the page content. The "body" tag is for the structure of the webpage.
        (Forgot that for a bit.)</p>
        <p> The h1-h6 are the same as formating the header tag</p>
        <nav>
            <h4>Navaigation</h4>
            <p> Navagation helps to organize links to related pages or bookmarks on the page. </p>

        <section>
            <p> Helps to separate the page content by themes. </p>
            <h4>Section</h4>
            <p>The section provides a warning that it lacks a heading in Validation.
            <br>The h1-h6 tags count as header elements.</p>

        </section>

        <aside>

            <h4>Aside</h4>
            <p> Should only be used to hold a tangent to<br>
                surrounding content. The aside tag does not require,<br>
                nor is a warning provided, for a header when Validating. </p>

        </aside>

        <article>
            <p> Is for content that is self contained and can stand alone. </p>
            <h3>Article</h3>
            The Article tag does provide a warning for a heading but not an error.

            <p> Specifies self contained content like pictures, code listings, ect.
            Alternately "picture" could be used but requires "source" tags and an ending "img" tag in case of compatibility issues. </p>

        <p>Time is used to add times and dates that user agents like calenders or phones can read. <br>

        <mark>Mark is used to highlight text as shown here.</mark>

        <details><summary>Summary</summary>
            <p>Summary is the heading tag of Details. Shows with or without information between the tags. Shows the details as part of a drop down list even without any css styling. The summary tags are similar to heading tags and label the section of the details.
            Provides additional information that user can open and close.
            struggling to figure out how to use the summary tag
            Found a reference on W3schools for summary using <p> tag and came back with an error.
            Details shows with or without information between the tags. Shows the details as part of a drop down list. Without any css styling.
